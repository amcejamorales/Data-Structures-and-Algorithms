### Array Algorithms

1. Given two sorted array of unique integers, return their intersection. Examples: ([1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]) => [3], ([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7]) => [].
1. Given a string of numbers, convert it into an array of numbers.
1. Given an array of integers and an integer, k, return an array of all sums in the array of k-consecutive integers. Example: ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3) => [6, 9, 12, 15]
1. Given an array of numbers and a target number, determine whether there are two numbers in the array that add up to the target number.
1. Given two lists of objects, determine whether they have the same objects, i.e., are they in essence the same list of objects?
1. Given an array that only contains 1s and 0s, determine whether all consecutive sequences of 1s are even in length. Examples: (01) => False, (101) => False, (011011) => True, (00) => True.
1. Given two arrays of integers, return an array with the sums of the elements at each index. Example: ([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) => [5, 7, 9].
1. Given an array and an integer value, return all the pairs of elements in the array that add up to the integer value. Use each element in the array only once.
1. Given a sorted array of integers and an integer input value, find the value in the array closest to the integer.
1. Given a sorted array of integers, return a string with the ranges in the array. Example: ([1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10]) => "1-3, 5, 8-10"
